2/11/2008

The interrupt logics are largely modified and are now very close to the real circuits.

In the older versions:
	- Each device requests the interrupt, sends the vector and goes into the in-service status only in the case that CPU can accept the interrupt.
	- These requests are always accepted and executed just now.
	- When the interrupt acception status is changed by the opecodes for example EI/RETI/RETN, CPU notifies to each devices to let them request the pending interrupt.
	- Realize Z80 family daisy chain by the pseudo device Z80PIC to control the priorities and receive RETI opecode.

This is because let CPU not to monitor the int-line in every opecodes.
But it causes some problems for example:
	- Timing problems.
	- End of Interrupt command in Z80SIO/uPD7201.
	- Using Z80 family devices with 80x86 and PIC8259.

In this release:
	- Each device can request the interrupt any time.
	- CPU checks the int-line in every opecodes.
	- When CPU accepts the request, CPU sends the ack signal to the device and receive the vector.
	- The device goes into the in-service status when receive the ack signal.
	- Realize Z80 family daisy chain by IEI/OEI signals supported in Z80 family devices.
	- Z80 checks the wired-or of int-lines from Z80 family devices.
